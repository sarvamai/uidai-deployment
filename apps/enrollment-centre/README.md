# Adding app.json to the Storage Bucket

Inside the `app-storage` bucket, you must create the full path structure as follows and then place the `app.json` file in the specified location:

```bash
app-storage/apps/sarvamai/default/uidai/app.json
```
Make sure that the directoriy `apps/sarvamai/default/uidai` is created within the `app-storage` bucket before adding the app.json file.
